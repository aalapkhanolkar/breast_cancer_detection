**Breast Cancer Detection Project using Machine Learning**

**Introduction**

Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer can significantly increase the chances of survival. In this project, we will use machine learning algorithms to analyze breast cancer data and predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not.

**Dataset**


We will use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 569 instances and 30 features, including the diagnosis (M=malignant, B=benign) as the target variable.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

Before we dive into building our machine learning model, let's perform some exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset better. We will use three different types of plots to visualize the data:
Bar Graph, Density Plot and Ellipse Pea Plot. All the plots are stored in "images" direftory.

Machine Learning Model

Now that we have performed some exploratory data analysis, let's build our machine learning model to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not. We will use the random forest algorithm for this task. The accuracy was 96%.

**Conclusion**

In this project, we used machine learning algorithms to analyze breast cancer data and predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not. We performed exploratory data analysis using bar graphs, density plots, and ellipse pea plots to understand the dataset better. We then built a random forest classifier and achieved an accuracy score of 96%. This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in detecting breast cancer at an early stage.
